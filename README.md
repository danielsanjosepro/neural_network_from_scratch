# Neural Network from Scratch 
Small Project: Neural Network with 2 hidden layers programmed from scratch. The goal of the ANN is to recognize numbers from the MNIST database.

The code can be tested in a matlab live script, which is similar to a python jupyter notebook.

# Remark:
This is a pretty bad and unoptimized implementation of a multilayer perceptron! This was the first time I digged into the topic and tried to implement by myself after reading about ANNs. There are more efficient and elegant ways to implement this!
